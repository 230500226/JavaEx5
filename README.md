# Fibonacci Series using Recursion

## This repository contains a Java implementation of the Fibonacci series using recursion.
How it works:

    The Fibonacci class provides a recursive method fibonacci(n) to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
    The base cases for the recursion are when n is 0 or 1, where the function returns n itself.
    For n greater than 1, the function recursively calculates the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.

## Usage:

    Clone this repository.
    Compile the Fibonacci.java file using a Java compiler.
    Run the compiled class with the desired input value (n).
